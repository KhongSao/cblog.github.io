      <description>So just what are these factors? They are timeless themes that run throughout our course. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if we are talking about medieval times, early modern, 19th century or the modern era - factors make an appearance in each one - When we look at the course as a whole it is clear that some factors make more of an impact and are more prominent in certain time periods than other.</description>

      <description>Caveats  This information is provided as a collection of random pointers that have worked well for me over the years This list is meant not as a checklist but merely pointers that have helped in and around school Some, most or all of which you may not agree with   In the Classroom  Wait for silence Fill a spray bottle with water, keep your whiteboard clean Have pupils perform tasks, hand out books, clean your room Number seats and books, helps with hands down questioning and book distribution When taking books in, have students open them at exactly where you will be marking  Working with technology  Printing - learn how to scan and leave a post for people Have a collection of coloured paper next to the printer for SEND Create email templates for typical emails such as detentions, reprographics and parents Control Q on SIMS Control Shift V will paste without formatting Keep records, establish a habit of scanning work -  Working with colleagues  Do not gossip If parents  Outside school  There will come times when you meet pupils outside of school, and for the most part it will be a smile nod, a smile or some other for of acknowledgment.</description>

      <description>References  My Emotions Observations    If you are not moving forward you are regressing.
  9 years in one school 192*4 768 768 lessons per years 6912 lessons   I am still early in my career but an interview would have been nice. The initial hit of being told less than 72 hours after submitted the application that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t made the cut for interview was tough; I thought at the very least I had earnt that.</description>
