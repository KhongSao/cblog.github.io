    <p>This was a long read</p>
<p>This was an education in place names.</p>
<p>I do because said member of staff was then at a loss for several minutes, for me it was an epoch, as to why there was sound but no video. Being a relatively new member of staff and early in my career, I did not have the occupational confidence to shout ALT-TAB. As time passes we gain confidence, sometimes overconfidence in our abilities (hence this blog). This post is the exemplification of that confidence in the hope that I never have to endure the technological Dark Ages that is an INSET day. Here you will find my musing on how to be more efficient as a teacher by using technology. My overall workflow is discussed, why it works for me, along with a selection of applications that I use on a day-to-day basis. For the most part, the sections can be read independently.
