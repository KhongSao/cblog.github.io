      <description>Quote 1) Seneca  Can you no longer see a road to freedom? It&amp;rsquo;s right in front of you. You need only turn over your wrists.
 Quote 2) 4chan  &amp;ldquo;I never got my people would kill themselves So if you want to die you obviously don&amp;rsquo;t give a shit. Like, about anyone. Because if there is anyone who loves you, you don&amp;rsquo;t give a fuck about them, or hurting them, and if there is not, there is no one to give a shit about.</description>

 82 years is the average lifespan of a male born in 1986. This would be 29,930 days or 299 (300) days.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say then you are in the final 1% or final 300days worth of time with those that brought you up - should that be if they havent left you already.</description>

      <description>Remember that CPD day, the one where the member of SLT had chosen to link a YouTube video in the PPT? Remember when the URL was clicked. Remember how, because it was in presentation mode the browser of the day (it was IE, let’s be real) played the video behind the Presentation? I do.
I do because said member of staff was then at a loss for several minutes, for me it was an epoch, as to why there was sound but no video.</description>

      <description>This was a long read
This was an education in place names.
I do because said member of staff was then at a loss for several minutes, for me it was an epoch, as to why there was sound but no video. Being a relatively new member of staff and early in my career, I did not have the occupational confidence to shout ALT-TAB. As time passes we gain confidence, sometimes overconfidence in our abilities (hence this blog).</description>
