      <description>Caveats  This information is provided as a collection of random pointers that have worked well for over the years This list is meant not as a checklist but merely pointers that have helped in and around school Some, most or all of which you may not agree with   In the Classroom  Wait for silence Fill a spray bottle with water, keep your whiteboard clean Have pupils perform tasks, hand out books, clean your room Number seats and books, helps with hands down questioning and book distribution When taking books in, have students open them at exactly where you will be marking  Working with technology  Printing - learn how to scan and leave a post for people Have a collection of coloured paper next to the printer for SEND Create email templates for typical emails such as detentions, reprographics and parents Control Q on SIMS Control Shift V will paste without formatting Keep records, establish a habit of scanning work -  Working with colleagues  Do not gossip If parents  Outside school  There will come times when you meet pupils outside of school, and for the most part it will be a smile nod, a smile or some other for of acknowledgment.</description>

      <description>The white liberal is the worst enemy to America, and the worst enemy to the black man. Let me explain what I mean by the white liberal. In America there is no such thing as Democrat or Republican anymore. In America you have liberals and conservatives. The only people living in the past who think in terms of I’m a Democrat or Republican, is the American Negro. He’s the one that runs around bragging about party affiliation.</description>

      <description>References  My Emotions Observations    If you are not moving forward you are regressing.
  9 years in one school 192*4 768 768 lessons per years 6912 lessons   I am still early in my career but an interview would have been nice. The initial hit of being told less than 72 hours after submitted the application that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t made the cut for interview was tough; I thought at the very least I had earnt that.</description>

82 years is the average lifespan of a male born in 1986. This would be 29,930 days or 299 (300) days.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say then you are in the final 1% or final 300days worth of time with those that brought you up - should that be if they havent left you already.</description>

      <description>Quote 1) Seneca  Can you no longer see a road to freedom? It&amp;rsquo;s right in front of you. You need only turn over your wrists.
 Quote 2) 4chan  &amp;ldquo;I never got my people would kill themselves So if you want to die you obviously don&amp;rsquo;t give a shit. Like, about anyone. Because if there is anyone who loves you, you don&amp;rsquo;t give a fuck about them, or hurting them, and if there is not, there is no one to give a shit about.</description>

      <description>Remember that CPD day, the one where the member of SLT had chosen to link a YouTube video in the PPT? Remember when the URL was clicked. Remember how, because it was in presentation mode the browser of the day (it was IE, let’s be real) played the video behind the Presentation? I do.
I do because said member of staff was then at a loss for several minutes, for me it was an epoch, as to why there was sound but no video.</description>
